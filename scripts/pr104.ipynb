    "The early detection of faulty (buggy) modules in software development and maintainance improves the effectiveness of quality enhancement activities and ultimately improves the overall quality of software products. Machine learning (*ML*) is widely being incorporated to master this task: a ML prediction model uses software metrics and faulty data from previous projects to detect failure-prone modules in future projects, so that the testing efforts can be targeted to those specific ‘risky' modules in the early phases of development cycle. In case faulty modules are not detected in early development phases, then the cost of getting the defect fixed increases multifold.\n",
    "This article has a comparison of 30 software quality prediction models built on five ML techniques: artificial neural network (*ANN*); support vector machine (*SVMs*); Decision Tree (*DTs*); k-Nearest Neighbor (*KNN*); and Naïve Bayes Classifiers (*NBC*), using five datasets from the NASA *PROMISE* repository plus a combined one. These models exploit the predictive power of static code metrics, the McCabe complexity metrics, for quality prediction. All thirty predictors are compared using a receiver operator curve (*ROC*), area under the curve (*AUC*), and accuracy as performance evaluation criteria. **The results show that the *ANN* technique for software quality prediction is promising for accurate quality prediction irrespective of the dataset used.**"

    "In software, the narrowest sense of product quality is commonly recognized as lack of \"bugs\" in the product. It is also the most basic meaning of conformance to requirements, because if the software contains too many functional defects, the basic requirement of providing the desired function is not met. This definition is usually expressed in two ways: **defect rate** (e.g., *number of defects per million lines of source code, per function point, or other unit*) and **reliability** (e.g., *number of failures per n hours of operation, mean time to failure, or the probability of failure free operation in a specified time*). <br>\n",
    "The two groups of metrics are correlated but are different enough to merit close attention. First, one measures the number or the time between failures, the other measures the defects relative to the software size (lines of code, function points, etc.). Second, although it is difficult to separate defects and failures in actual measurements and data tracking, failures and defects (or faults) have different meanings. **For practical purposes, we will not distinguish between the two terms**, but indeed, in many development organizations the two terms are used synonymously. <br>\n",
    "Regardless of their differences and similarities, *MTTF* and *defect density* are the two key metrics for **intrinsic product quality**. Accordingly, there exist two main types of software reliability growth models — the time between failures models and the defect count (defect rate) models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer satisfaction** is a complementary perspective on product quality, and is usually measured by percent satisfied or nonsatisfied (*neutral and dissatisfied*) from customer satisfaction surveys.\n",
    "The role of the customer, as it relates to quality, can never be overstated. From a customer's standpoint, quality is the customer's perceived value of the purchased product, based on a variety of variables such as price, performance, reliability, and satisfaction. So eventually, **the de facto definition of software quality consists of two levels: intrinsic product quality and customer satisfaction.** \n",

    "So many quality attributes and metrics with numerous Quality Assurance techniques are developed, but still the question: how to ensure that the resulting product will possess good quality? The early detection of failure-prone modules directly correlates with the quality of end-product. The early detection of faulty (buggy) modules improves the effectiveness of quality enhancement activities and ultimately improves the overall quality. <br>\n",
    "In this paper, the software fault prediction is used as an indicator for software quality for two reasons:\n",
    "- **Quality is inversely proportional to the failures, which in turn caused by faults** *(development anomalies)* \n",
    "<br>\n",

    "- **The early fault detection provides decisive power to the entire development team to strategically allocate the testing resources.**"

    "In the paper, attributes #1, #2, #3 and #4 are selected as features to build the quality predictors.\n",
    "The selected features are the McCabe’s Complexity metrics *(Thomas, 1976)*. These are static code metrics and in direct association with the quality of the software. The correlation among the selected features for the classes is shown in **Figure 3**.\n",
    "The reason of using static code metrics as predictors is two-fold:\n",
    "- **First**, these attributes are successfully used and widely accepted to predict the software defects and quality;\n",
    "- **Second**, these metrics can be computed very easily at low costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief description of these four features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lines of Code `LOC`**: The LOC count is usually for executable statements. It is actually a count of instruction statements according to McCabe's line counting conventions.\n",
    "- **Cyclomatic Complexity `v(G)`**: Measures the number of \"linearly independent paths\". A set of paths is said to be linearly independent if no path in the set is a linear combination of any other paths in the set through a program's \"flowgraph\". $v(G)$ is calculated by $v(G) = e - n + 2$ where $G$ is a program's flowgraph, $e$ is the number of arcs in the flowgraph, and $n$ is the number of nodes in the flowgraph. The standard McCabe rules ( $v(G)>10$ ), are used to identify fault-prone module.\n",
    "- **Essential Complexity `ev(G)`**: It is a measure of the inherent complexity of a software system. It is the extent to which a flowgraph can be \"reduced\" by decomposing all the subflowgraphs of $G$ that are \"D-structured primes\". $ev(G)$ is calculated using $ev(G)= v(G) - m$ where $m$ is the number of subflowgraphs of \"G\" that are D-structured primes.\n",
    "- **Design Complexity `iv(G)`**: It is the cyclomatic complexity of a module's reduced flowgraph.  The flowgraph, $G$, of a module is reduced to eliminate any complexity which does not influence the interrelationship between design modules. According to McCabe, this complexity measurement reflects the modules calling patterns to its immediate subordinate modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design complexity is similar to inherent complexity, in that it is a measure of the complexity that is inherent in the design and architecture of the software. However, design complexity specifically focuses on the design of the system, while inherent complexity is a broader measure of the overall complexity of the software."
